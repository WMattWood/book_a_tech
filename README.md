# book_a_tech
this is a mockup/code spike on a system for scheduling freelance workers
specifically this is modeled after the montreal system for connecting 'tech'
gig workers with event dates.  functionality is included to allow techs to
indicate dates they are not available.  during available dates, an SMS system
will message all available techs and allow them to 'self-hire' themselves to
specific dates. this is not intended to be a fully automated system, although
under optimal balancing of gigs to workers and open positions to qualified
technicians, it could come close to being fully automated.

under the current design iteration (let's say beta v0.1) gigs would need to be
manually entered by a primary software-operator. eventually, a client database
could be constructed and paired with client-facing access web pages that would
allow them to populate their gigs themselves. [ NOTE: Because there would be no
perceived outcome of submitting a gig, perhaps give the client an option to enter
in their own cellphone number to view "what the message will look like" to techs,
or maybe have a confirmation text with a link to a calendar that shows the event
logged.  (Maybe maybe also have a core team of techs that can jump onto a booking
quickly once the business is established.)]
